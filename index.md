  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
HBRL Research Group (HBRLRG)'s current research focuses on bridging AI-driven materials synthesis design with experimental realization by elucidating surface chemical reaction mechanisms for next-generation semiconductor device fabrication. His group actively explores a wide range of theoretical methodologies-including deep learning diffusion models, density functional theory combined with machine-learning force fields, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations-as well as atomic-scale synthesis techniques such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), atomic layer modulation (ALM), and area-selective deposition (ASD). The overarching goal of Prof. Lee's research program is to design novel materials with targeted properties using AI-based approaches and to realize them through advanced silicon device fabrication processes.
